Answers to questions:
1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
-------------------------------------
Database is Multi-AZ database. Right now it have one instance in one of two AZs. 
If there is some connection issue with working instance, second instance is prepared in secondary zone.
It means there is no Recovery Time Objective.

If both instances have issue then RTO is 2 hours:

00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> an amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:36 --> start diagnoses
01:00 --> Root cause is discovered
01:30 --> Remediation started
01:59 --> Remediation complete

Notes: We have 24/7 support team, Remote access to systems and Documented recovery procedure.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
-----------------------------------------
If we need to switch DB from one region to another, then RTO is 2,5 hours:

00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> an amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:36 --> start diagnoses
01:00 --> Root cause is discovered
01:30 --> Remediation started
01:59 --> Remediation complete
02:30 --> Switch read replica to master role ( reconfigure to read write replica, reconfigure to master role )

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
-------------------------------------

We have enabled backups on every 30 days. We also have 24/7 support team.
Estimated minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is:
00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> an amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:30 --> Staring Restore in point and time
00:50 --> Restoring is finished

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage should be 50 minutes. Maximum RPO can be 30 days.


4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
-----------------------------------------
We have enabled backups on every 30 days. We also have 24/7 support team.
Estimated minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is:
00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> an amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:30 --> Staring Restore in point and time in new region
00:50 --> Restoring is finished

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage should be 50 minutes. Maximum RPO can be 30 days.
