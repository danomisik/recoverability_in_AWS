What we have:
1. We have 24/7 support team
2. Remote access to systems
3. Documented recovery procedure.
4. Backup every 30 days
5. Read replica in different region

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
-------------------------------------
Database is Multi-AZ database. Right now it have one primary instance in first of two AZs and standby instance in second AZ. In this Multi-AZ configuration, backups occur on the standby to reduce impact on the primary. 
If an Availability Zone failure or primary instance failure occurs, availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically one to two minutes for standby database.
Minimum RTO will be 1-2 minutes.

Note that Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments do not failover automatically in response to database operations such as long running queries, deadlocks or database corruption errors.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
-----------------------------------------
If one region fails, we have to promote the read replica to take place of master database. This requires manual intervention.

00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> An amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:36 --> Start promotion of read replica
01:00 --> Promotion of read replica completed

Minimum RTO will be 1 hour.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
-------------------------------------
Failover in this case is automated. Staff is not required to restore the database.
If an Availability Zone failure or primary instance failure occurs, availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically one to two minutes for standby database.
Backup is set to every 30 days. It means if there is fail in Primary database right after backup... Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage should 1-2 minutes. Maximum RPO can be 30 days.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
-----------------------------------------
In this case we have Read Replica in second region. Amazon RDS uses the asynchronous replication method of the DB engine to update the Read Replica whenever there is a change made on the source DB instance. 
An important metric to monitor with a Read Replica is the replica lag, which is the amount of time that the replica is behind the source database. 
A replica lag can impact your recovery. 
Replica lag can vary based on the network latency between the source and destination Regions. 
It can also be affected by the amount of traffic that is being replicated. 
Because Read Replicas have a running DB instance, the time required to recover after a disaster is lower.
The disadvantages of this case is that you need to perform a manual recover.

00:00 --> Problem happens
00:05 --> An amount of time passed before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 --> Alert triggers on all staff
00:26 --> Get out of bed, login
00:36 --> Start promotion of read replica
01:00 --> Promotion of read replica completed

From now you will not lose any data. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage should be 1 hour. Maximum RPO should be again 1 hour, because Read replica is asynchronious replication of Primary database and is not influenced by backups every 30 days.

Dictionary:
Recover Time Objective (RTO) represents how many hours it takes you to return to a working state after a disaster. 
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) --> the maximum amount of time over which you can lose data
